# R Code to Compute Sensor-Derived Upper Limb Variables from Bilateral Wrist-Worn Accelerometers

This repository includes the R code scripts used to process all upper limb accelerometry data for the project, Harmonized Upper and Lower Limb Accelerometry Data. This is a harmonized dataset of accelerometry data collected by Washington University School of Medicine investigators and collaborators. The harmonized dataset includes data from eight studies, 790 individuals with a variety of health conditions, and 2,885 recording days of accelerometry data. The dataset has been submitted to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Data and Specimen Hub (DASH) repository.  This README document will be updated with a link to the dataset, once it is available.

The purpose of sharing this code is to provide transparency with how the upper limb accelerometry data were processed and allow others to replicate these processing procedures, if they choose. In all eight studies, participants wore bilateral wrist accelerometers. During the harmonization process, all upper limb accelerometry data were processed using custom written R code scrips. All code scripts calculated the upper limb sensor variables the same way; however, variations in the number of recording days and in-lab vs. out-of-lab time for each study protocol resulted in some differences in processing procedures across studies. All upper limb sensor variables were calculated from recording times in daily life (i.e., outside the clinic/lab), with the exception of the Activity Level and Intensity of Older Adults in Skilled Nursing Rehabilitation Measured via Actigraphy in which participants were residing in a skilled nursing facility. The table below displays the code script used to process data from each study as well as details about the processing procedures.

|Study	| R Script Name |	Processing Procedures|
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
|Mapping Upper Limb Performance | MappingCohort_PMC844293.R|	One day of accelerometry data processed, per study protocol.|

|Does Task-Specific Training Improve Upper Limb Performance in Daily Life Poststroke?|	Dose_PMC5016233.R|	One day of accelerometry data processed, per study protocol. First 1.5 hours of recording time were removed due to in-lab time. Files were trimmed if > 24 hours after removing first 1.5 hours.|

|Upper Limb Activity in Adults: Referent Values Using Accelerometry	|AdultReferent_PMC3905245.R|	One day of accelerometry data processed, per study protocol. First 2 hours of recording time were removed due to in-lab time.|
|Detection of Pediatric Upper Extremity Motor Activity and Deficits with Accelerometry|	Pediatric_PMC6487720.R	|Four days of accelerometry data were processed, per study protocol. The 30 minutes at the beginning and end of the file for each day were trimmed.|
|A Feasibility Study of Bilateral Wrist Sensors for Measuring Motor Traits in Children with Autism|	AutismPilot_PMC9974780.R	|Two, 12-hour recording days per participant were processed, per the study protocol.|
|Associations Between Coordination and Wearable Sensor Variables	|Encoding_PMID38189355.R|	Two days of accelerometry data were processed. In-lab time was removed.|

For simplicity, this repository also includes a generic code script, UpperLimbAccelerometry.R that provides an overview of each of the upper limb sensor variable calculations for a 24-hour recording period.
Executing these code scripts requires reading in four csv files: two down-sampled 1 Hz data files extracted from ActiLife 6 software (in ActiGraph activity counts, ActiGraph Inc, Pensacola, Florida) and two raw 30 Hz acceleration data files (in gravitational units), also extracted from ActiLife 6 software. Additional details regarding ActiGraphâ€™s down-sampling procedures and quantification of activity counts can be found in the publication:
Neishabouri A, Nguyen J, Samuelsson J, et al. Quantification of acceleration as activity counts in ActiGraph wearable. Sci Rep. 2022;12(1):11958. 
The code uses these data files to compute 26 variables that reflect movement of the upper limbs in daily life. A description of each variable and the sampling frequency from which the variable was computed is displayed in the table below.

A publication about the harmonized dataset is in preparation. The doi associated with this publication will be added to this README file, once available. We also encourage individuals who are interested in learning more about this dataset and the upper limb accelerometry variables to explore the R Shiny Object associated with the data at: https://langlab.shinyapps.io/harmonized_data/. At present, the R Shiny Object only includes data from pediatric participants. However, it is being updated to include data from adult participants.
